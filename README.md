# Yamanu Game Engine 2 Q&A #

### What is Yamanu Game Engine? ###

Yamanu Game Engine is a free and open source Java game engine. It is mainly used for 2D games

### Contribution guidelines ###

* Writing tests
* Code review
* Other guidelines

### Why the update to 2.0 already? ###

I realized all of the problems with the original Yamanu, and knew that it was started off wrong, and there was no way to fix it. I decided to create a whole new Yamanu, but this time, make sure everything is more flexible and built the right way.

### What's better about this new Yamanu? ###

There are many things that are much better that before. It's more object-oriented. When I started the original Yamanu, I didn't have as large of a handle on OOP as I do now. Now things are more flexible because of this. There is also less "main class" code to be written, and most IDE's will auto complete certain code, so it's faster and more concise. It's more flexible. The original Yamanu was not fitting to everyone's needs, but mostly to mine. If I want Yamanu to be useable by everyone, then it needs to be more flexible, which I think it is so far. And instead of adding really stupid useless stuff I myself would only use, I will be adding things that apply to everyone.

### What about documentation? ###

The only documentation will be the JavaDocs in the code. I will be uploading a video once Yamanu 2 is ready for the public, that will explain the basic features of the game engine. I might make the GitHub wiki the area for documentation, but that is not very likely.

### How can I help? ###

If you're a skilled enough programmer in Java, and can prove yourself to me, then you can help develop Yamanu. Other than that, donating would be just fine!
